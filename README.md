# Video Game Sales Prediction Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict `video game sales` based on various features and conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset. The analysis includes `data visualization`, `data preprocessing`, `Regression`, `model training`, and `evaluation`. It provides insights into how different factors influence video game sales and how well the predictive model performs.
## Dataset
The dataset that Iâ€™m using here is from [`kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.
