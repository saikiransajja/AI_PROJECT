# **<i>Video Game Sales Prediction Analysis</i>**
## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict `video game sales` based on various features and conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset. The analysis includes `data visualization`, `data preprocessing`, `Regression`, `model training`, and `evaluation`. It provides insights into how different factors influence video game sales and how well the predictive model performs.
## **Dataset**
The dataset that Iâ€™m using here is from [`kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). It was generated by a scrape of `vgchartz.com`. <br>
Fields include : <br>
`Name` - The Name of the Game <br>
`Platform` - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.) <br>
`Year_of_Release` - Year of the game's release <br>
`Genre` - Genre of the game <br>
`Publisher` - Publisher of the game <br>
`NA_Sales` - Sales in North America (in millions) <br>
`EU_Sales` - Sales in Europe (in millions) <br>
`JP_Sales` - Sales in Japan (in millions) <br>
`Other_Sales` - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions) <br>
`Global_Sales` - Total worldwide sales <br>
`Critic_Score` - The score given by the critics <br>
`Critic_Count` - No of Critics <br>
`User_Score` - The Score Given By the user <br>
`User_Count` - The count of users <br>
`Developer` - The developer of the Game <br>
`Rating` - The rating of the Game <br>
## **Language**
`Python` (Version - Python 3.11.1)
## **Libraries**

## **Coding Environment**
`Visual Studio Code` <br>
`Jupyter Notebook` (Version - IPython 8.17.2) <br>
`Anaconda` (Version - conda 23.7.4) <br>
