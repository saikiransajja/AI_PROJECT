# **<i>Video Game Sales Prediction Analysis</i>**
## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict `video game sales` based on various features and conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset. The analysis includes `data visualization`, `data preprocessing`, `Regression`, `model training`, and `evaluation`. It provides insights into how different factors influence video game sales and how well the predictive model performs.
## **Dataset**
The dataset that Iâ€™m using here is from [`kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.
## **Language**
`Python` (Version - Python 3.11.1)
## **Libraries**
The libraries that I have used in this project are : `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Scikit-Learn`(`SimpleImputer`, `ColumnTransformer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `XGBRegressor`)
