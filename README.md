# **<i>Video Game Sales Prediction Analysis</i>**
## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict `video game sales` based on various features and conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset. The analysis includes `data visualization`, `data preprocessing`, `Regression`, `model training`, and `evaluation`. It provides insights into how different factors influence video game sales and how well the predictive model performs.
## **Dataset**
The dataset that Iâ€™m using here is from [`kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.
Fields include :
`Name` - The Name of the Game
`Platform` - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
`Year_of_Release` - Year of the game's release
`Genre` - Genre of the game
`Publisher` - Publisher of the game
`NA_Sales` - Sales in North America (in millions)
`EU_Sales` - Sales in Europe (in millions)
`JP_Sales` - Sales in Japan (in millions)
`Other_Sales` - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
`Global_Sales` - Total worldwide sales
`Critic_Score` - The score given by the critics
`Critic_Count` - No of Critics
`User_Score` - The Score Given By the user
`User_Count` - The count of users
`Developer` - The developer of the Game
`Rating` - The rating of the Game
## **Language**
`Python` (Version - Python 3.11.1)
## **Libraries**
The libraries that I have used in this project are : `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Scikit-Learn`(`SimpleImputer`, `ColumnTransformer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `XGBRegressor`)
